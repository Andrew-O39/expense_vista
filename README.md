# ExpenseVista

**ExpenseVista** is a personal finance web application that allows users to create budgets, log daily expenses, track incomes, and receive email alerts when their spending approaches or exceeds their set limits. The application is designed to help users stay in control of their finances through proactive and timely notifications.

- The application provides summaries of both spending and income by category and time period.
- **Financial overview dashboard:** shows total income, total expenses, and net balance, with breakdowns over time.
- Automated email alerts are sent when spending reaches 50% of the budget, nears the limit (80–99%), or exceeds the limit (100%+).
- Email notifications are designed using a styled HTML template with clear and friendly formatting.
- SendGrid integration ensures reliable delivery of notification emails.
- Emails include personalized content such as the user’s username, current category, and budget period, as well as the current year.
